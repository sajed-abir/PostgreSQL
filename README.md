## BACKGROUND
Born from a drive to better understand the data analyst job market, this project aims to uncover the most valuable and in-demand skills, helping others efficiently identify optimal career opportunities.

### Questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top paying data(analyst) jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for different data roles?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

## TOOLS I USED
To explore the data analyst job market in depth, I relied on a set of powerful tools:

- **SQL** : The heart of my exploration, helping uncover patterns and insights hidden in the data.
- **PostgreSQL** : A reliable database engine that handled large job datasets with speed and precision.
- **Visual Studio Code** : My trusted environment for crafting and running SQL queries with ease.
- **Git & GitHub** : For version control and collaboration — ensuring every step of the project was well-documented and shareable.

## THE ANALYSIS
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here’s how I approached each question:
### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location / work from home, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE --Change the job_title_short to specify your desired roles eg. Data Engineer/Data Scientist
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    --AND job_location = 'Anywhere'--
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT(10);
```
Here's the visualization:

Here's the breakdown of the top data analyst jobs:
- Remote Data Analyst roles offer the highest salaries, with positions like Mantys’ Data Analyst reaching $650,000/year.
- Leadership and strategic roles, such as Director of Analytics at Meta, command premium pay.
- Hybrid and specialized roles in marketing, automation, and performance analysis remain highly sought-after and well-compensated.

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
To understand what skills are required for the top-paying jobs, I joined the job postings with the skills data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS(
    SELECT 
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE --Change the job_title_short to specify your desired roles eg. Data Engineer/Data Scientist
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT(10)
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id;
```
The visualizaton:

*Bar Chart generated by calude.ai*

Here's the breakdown:
- **SQL and Python are essential** : Almost all jobs require them, along with Tableau, Excel, or Pandas.
- **Higher seniority → higher salary** : Directors/Associate Directors (~$255k) earn significantly more than mid-level Analysts (~$180k–$232k).
- **Cloud & Big Data matter for senior roles** : AWS, Azure, Databricks, and Snowflake appear mostly in higher-level positions.

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
This query helped identify the skills most frequently requested in job postings, directing focus to areas with high demand.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    /*here you can put your desired data roles and other filters like location, work from home etc*/
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY skills
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
